> When I imagine an organization I have in mind ... an interlocking network of communication processes” (Taylor, 2003: 12)

> Communication serves as the main mechanism to create (shared) meaning and achieves all three base criteria for _organisationality_ ([[daos-display-organizationality]])

Communications are the fundamental unit of human coordination. They can be observed, logged and designed which allows us to plan DAO journeys and concretely describe our design choices. Being communication-first enables DAOs to build culture ([[culture-is-a-product]]) and share their ethos ([[brands-can-be-meaningful]]), before involving aspects like governance and token design ([[tokens-are-products]]).

Without the correct communication, shared meaning cannot be created which leads to the inability to create and share value.
