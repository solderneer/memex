> **A densely hyperlinked set of notes that slowly grows over time feels strangely alive and organic**

This notebook is a playground, a rough scratchpad for my thoughts and ideas, a place where I'm not afraid to get crazy and wild. So, it is often unstructured and messy, but I think thinking aloud in public is an important part of inviting open-minded discussion.

With that in mind, I want this digital space to be approachable for as many people as possible. So, to get you started, this page contains paths you might enjoy meandering along, by pulling together thoughts that are on the [[top-of-mind]]. Currently, expect to find notes on:

- 🧠  Human-Machine Interfaces
- 💻  Decentralized Organizations
- 🥳  Culture and Brands
- 💡  Electrical Engineering
- 🏋‍♂  Health, Wellness and Quantified Self
- 🌱  Self-improvement and personal growth
