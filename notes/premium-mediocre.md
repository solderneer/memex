[Premium mediocrity](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/) is a transitional civilisational state, that lies between industrial modernity and digital post-scarcity. **It is also a state that reflects a pattern of consumption signalling upward social mobility, while living in a reality of anxiety-ridden downward mobility.**

In short, premium mediocrity is a state of potential social mobility. A self-aware pretense to both boomer parents and building-the-future technocrats to keep them happy. You want parents to think you made it, and you want leaders to keep building The New Economy.

>That inventing the future means showing up to help sustain the fiction while it is being built out. It means taking risks to make money, meaning, or both.

>This is the tense, fragile, calm of a social order pretending furiously that it isÂ _not_Â unraveling

The alternatives:
1. The pursuit of artisan skill and the denial of financial unsustainability - named Molly Millenial by Venkatesh Rao (meaning no money)
2. The pursuit of arbitrage profits and the denial of other meaning - named Max Millenial by Venkatesh Rao (money no meaning)

In comparison, premium mediocre Maya Millenial acknowledges the script change ([[society-is-scripted]]) and bets for both meaning and money.

In a system where [[culture-is-a-service]], Premium Mediocrity can also be seen as a collective hallucination where everyone aspires towards imagined future ideals and culture. It is the slice of the cultural pie that serves the disappearing middle class.
