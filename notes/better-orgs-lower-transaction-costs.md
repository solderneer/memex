To quote [A Prehistory of DAOs](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q):

>Â ...markets create unaccounted for transaction costs. These transaction costs could arise from price discovery, contract negotiation, or onboarding for a service, which can be mitigated by retaining services in a company.

>...Â the promise of DAOs lies in using technical governance protocols to reduce transaction costs.

Better organisations reduce the transaction costs of collaborating. Hiring, co-ownership and other format contracts are **attempts at aligning incentives and lowering the barrier to collaboration**. An essential part of this is cultivating a high-trust environment, where it is easy to form relationships and get stuff done.

Heterarchical organisations like those described in [[heterarchies-are-the-ideal-civil-society]], are good at aligning incentives across a plurality of people. The ability to coordinate across different levels of trust, in a heterarchy, would allow these network collectives to solve _locally-complex problems on a global scale_ which is relevant to [[wicked-problems]] and [[local-care-for-global-health]].
