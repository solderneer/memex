>The blockchain community understands that blockchains can helpÂ **align incentives**Â among a tribe of token holders. Each token holder hasÂ [**skin in the game**](https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/042528462X). But the benefit is actually more general than simplyÂ _aligning_Â incentives: you canÂ _design_Â incentives of your choosing, by giving them block rewards. Put another way:Â **you can get people to do stuff, by rewarding them with tokens.**Â Blockchains areÂ **incentive machines**.

>Bitcoin is the first example of a new form of life. It lives and breathes on the internet. It lives because it can pay people to keep it alive. It lives because it performs a useful service that people will pay it to perform. â€¦ It canâ€™t be stopped. It canâ€™t even be interrupted. If nuclear war destroyed half of our planet, it would continue to live, uncorrupted.

>We have a life form that we basically canâ€™t stop, which is optimizing maniacally for that most precious resource â€” energy. This life form is called Bitcoin.

We need to get incentives right when we build tokenised systems. Once they get started, they can be **very** hard to stop.
