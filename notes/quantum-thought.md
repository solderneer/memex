>We could describe this as "quantum thought": being able to contemplate 0 and 1 simultaneously, as well as the spectrum of probability between. If you can cultivate honest **humility**, you may just learn how to hold all three in superposition without any grasping after certainty, and thereby make more balanced decisions.

Thinking in terms of **complementary opposites** is important. In a complex world, complete planning and prediction is impossible. The most brilliant minds **can hold two opposing thoughts in mind** at the same time.

>Those who haveÂ **positively**Â changed the world did so because they learnt how to negotiate complexity, rather than impose their own will on things.
