> Since I am studying the Electrical and Engineering degree in [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), I spend a good portion of my year here. This page is a mosaic of various reflections and lists related to London.

**London is a nostalgic city**, the first time I saw London it felt familiar, almost like I had been here before. Part of that could be because of how frequently it is featured in movies and shows. It is home to amazingly diverse people, incredible museums and a great nightlife.

It started out feeling intimidating, especially being the first time being away from [[singapore|Singapore]] for me. But it grew on me quickly, I find myself feeling comfortably in place in [[london-uk|London]] now.

Amidst the chaos, and the banker bros, there are pockets of highly interesting people working on fascinating problems. Finding my tribe is the key, I think that applies more broadly to other countries as well. I do find myself missing the sense of creative ambition, or the impetus to do things to change the world here.
