This is me coming out of a long 3 hour long reorganization adventure of my Obsidian, after reading [Must Have Obsidian Plugins](https://pkmjournal.com/the-must-have-obsidian-plugins-5a99821b18b2). My initial instinct was to organize everything in folders, trying to capture the right files into the right notes. I quickly realized:

1. What if one thing had multiple folders it belonged in
2. The effort of putting things in the correct folder is too high, even with tools like [Auto Note Mover]([https://github.com/farux/obsidian-auto-note-mover](https://github.com/farux/obsidian-auto-note-mover))

Flat directories of files lower cognitive burden, and let you focus on writing things rather than organising things. That's one of the reasons I prefer Obsidian to Notion.

Instead of structuring and filing notes, I have opted instead to use tags and YAML frontmatter to organize notes. This keeps this organized without the cognitive burden of reorganizing notes. When dealing with a highly-linked datastructure, moving things around also breaks links. Using tags avoids broken brains even during extensive reorgs.
