A few choice quotes from [Meditations on Moloch](https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/Meditations-On-Moloch):

>Things are easy to solve from a godâ€™s-eye-view, so if everyone comes together into a superorganism, that superorganism can solve problems with ease and finesse.

>The two active ingredients of government are laws plus violence â€“ or more abstractly agreements plus enforcement mechanism. Many other things besides governments share these two active ingredients and so are able to act as coordination mechanisms to avoid traps.

>The only way to avoid having all human values gradually ground down by optimization-competition is to install a Gardener over the entire universe who optimizes for human values.

This line of thinking also forms the basis for neo-reactionary (pro monarchy, pro CEO style governance) thought. See [[dark-enlightenment]].
