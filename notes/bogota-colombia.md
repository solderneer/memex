I visited [[bogota-colombia|Bogota]] to attend Devcon VI - which is one of the biggest [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) conferences held annually. The city itself is beautifully situated in a valley surrounded by mountains, which meant some pretty cool views. Since I was only there for a conference, unfortunately, most of my time was actually spent at the Devcon VI conference center.

But the conference really outdid itself by serving local cuisine and attempting to immerse its attendees in the culture. Somewhat disappointingly, I am not a fan of Colombian cuisine, and food is so important to me that this alone is a dealbreaker for me visiting again for leisure.

Similar to [[hochiminh-vietnam]], [[bogota-colombia|Bogota]] is filled with a vibrant, chaotic energy: the Colombians at Devcon VI were all incredible in their own unique ways. This to me really shows me the potential in developing regions like Latin America and South East Asia.
