Excerpts from [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems)

>A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you donâ€™t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.

>However, I've found that goals are good forÂ _planning_Â your progress and systems are good for actuallyÂ _making_Â progress.
