Another addition to the DAO notes, alongside [[daos-are-digital-organisms]]. It seems there are tons of lenses to use to view DAOs, which also makes sense - [[the-eight-metaphors-of-organization]].

Anyway, Chase Chapman, in [Digital Cities](https://www.metropolis.space/research/digital-cities) asserts:

>the next generation of cities wonâ€™t be built with wood or bricks or steel. This time around, cities will be built with code.

and also says:

>People often talk of the DAO landscape as an ecology. We believe the landscape is actually more like a city of cities â€“ a Metropolis of interconnected and interdependent organizations.

I have mixed feelings on this. I like the metaphor of [[daos-are-digital-organisms]], because it really, and I mean really embraces the complexity inherent in autopoietic life. Organizations can be beautiful, and evolving and responsive. The metaphor of _city of cities_ gives the whole thing a mechanistic spin. A bit too much of one for my taste.
