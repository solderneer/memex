[[companies-constrain-relations-for-legibility]]. But in DAOs, we aim to acknowledge and reward the multitude of relationships and values that are generated by our contributors. In a DAO, we could be a:

* Worker or contributor
* Owner, partner and associate
* User and audience
* Investor
* Operator
* Steward
* Enthusiast and supporter

and any combination of the roles above. The social contract of DAO promises that all streams of value creation will be accounted for and rewarded. A DAO aims to deal with all the relations of its members and allocate value to them: **a social contract that contains infinite relations.**
