_Organisationality_ is a concept originally proposed by [Ahrne and Brunsson (2011)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1350508410376256) and was intended as a more granular definition for organisations than the existing binary one. Social collectives are organisational is they display the following criteria:

- first, they are characterized by interconnected instances of decision-making ([Ahrne and Brunsson, 2011](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1350508410376256))
- second, these instances of decision-making are attributed to a collective entity or actor ([King et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1090.0443));
- third, collective identity is accomplished through speech acts that aim to delineate what the entity or actor is or does (â€˜identity claimsâ€™; seeÂ [Bartel and Dutton, 2001](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Ambiguous-Organizational-Memberships%3A-Constructing-Hogg-Terry/1f920a3748cbfc48395a38a6828808f61b698bdc)).

In the first and second criteria, there is a reference to collective decision making. DAOs are commonly referred to as "group chats with a bank account". Without collective sense and decision making, a group of people cease to be a collection. This is why [[daos-should-be-communication-first]].

In the final criteria, the concept of collective identity is also about a shared ethos and sense of meaning. These are the _collective vibes_ that are referenced in [[daos-are-digital-organisms]].
