A wicked problem, is a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve, because of requirements that are dynamic, contradictory, incomplete or _interdependent_ in a way that is difficult to disentangle.

The term originated in social policy, which tends to deal extensively with socially wicked problems. So the critical assessment was that a purely scientific-engineering approach cannot solve wicked problems because of the complexity of the problem.

>The search for scientific bases for confronting problems of social policy is bound to fail because of the nature of these problems... Policy problems cannot be definitively described. Moreover, in a pluralistic society there is nothing like the indisputable public good; there is no objective definition of equity; policies that respond to [social problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_problem "Social problem") cannot be meaningfully correct or false; and it makes no sense to talk about "optimal solutions" to these problems... Even worse, there are no solutions in the sense of definitive answers.

[Russell L. Ackoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Ackoff "Russell Ackoff") wrote about complex problems as messes: "Every problem interacts with other problems and is therefore part of a set of interrelated problems, a system of problems.... I choose to call such a system a mess."

A system of systems: a criteria is laid out here:

1. No unique "correct" view of the problem;
2. Different views of the problem and contradictory solutions;
3. Most problems are connected to other problems;
4. Data are often uncertain or missing;
5. Multiple value conflicts;
6. [Ideological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological "Ideological") and cultural constraints;
7. Political constraints;
8. Economic constraints;
9. Often a-logical or illogical or multi-valued thinking;
10. Numerous possible intervention points;
11. Consequences difficult to imagine;
12. Considerable uncertainty, ambiguity;
13. Great resistance to change; and,
14. Problem solver(s) out of contact with the problems and potential solutions.

Solutions could be authoritative (reduce the number of stakeholders with power), competitive (get them to pit their ideas against one another, susceptible to market failure), collaboration (consensus making, time consuming, issues of absolute beliefs). Collaboration is probably the most preferable here.

>The first is to shift the goal of action on significant problems from "solution" to "intervention." Instead of seeking the answer that totally eliminates a problem, one should recognize that actions occur in an ongoing process, and further actions will always be needed. - [Wholesome Design for Wicked Problems](http://publicsphereproject.org/content/wholesome-design-wicked-problems)

There's also some cool research on [[public-policy-networks]] for healthcare.

In a sense, solutions to [[wicked-problems]] are also [[love-is-a-coop-infinite-game|infinite games]]. Which is related to my idea on [[intervention-machines]].
