These insights are from [Bluebird](https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/038533351X/mattwebbsinterco) by Kurt Vonnegut and highlighted by [Matt Webb's blog, Interconnected](https://interconnected.org/home/2003/01/22/the_following_is).

To open a population to new ideas, requires a specific type of team of specialists, else life will go on as usual no matter how bad the situation is.

**The Authentic Genius**: A person capable of having great ideas not commonly in circulation, _"A genius working alone is dismissed as a lunatic"_.

**The Intelligent Citizen:** A person in good-standing in their community, who understands and admires the fresh ideas of the genius and who testifies that the genius is far from mad. A person like this alone, _"yearns for change but is unable to give a shape to the change"_.

**The Explainer:** A person who can explain/sell anything, no matter how hard it is to explain. Can say almost anything to make something exciting or interesting. Working alone, this person would be considered _"full of shit"_.
