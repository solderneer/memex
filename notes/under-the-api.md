To live under the API is to be a slave to automation. **In the modern economy, you either tell the APIs what to do or you are told by the APIs what to do.** This is the new white-collar, blue-collar distinction.

Uber drivers, Food delivery workers, Mechanical Turk workers are all examples of people living under the API.
