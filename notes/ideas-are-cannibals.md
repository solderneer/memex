When collective scripts as described in [[society-is-scripted]] are working correctly, we get harmonious social order where people evolve in a predictable and synchronized way.

But most societies today rely on a large set of scripts, of which atleast some are unravelling. This is a process of destruction and pain, unfortunately the pain is often unstoppable. Some big exampes are, healthcare in the US, education in Singapore, etc etc.

Ideas are creative processes that feed off of the destruction in unravelling scripts. Specifically, ideas take unravelling scripts to stitch together new behaviour models in the form of a set of different, more situation-appropriate scripts.

>Â Creative destruction is aÂ _flow_Â from an unraveling reality into an emerging one.

In that way, **ideas create discontinuous changes in behaviour** and the best ideas are _seed behaviours_ that induce a whole set of scripts.
