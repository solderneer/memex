Destruction is path-dependent as the specific situation of the collapse of a concept is hard to predict in a complex society. Unravelling scripts ([[society-is-scripted]]) rarely unravel in predictable ways, they have sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

And because [[ideas-are-cannibals]] and feed off the destructive energy of unravelling scripts, creation is necessarily tied to being path-dependent as well. This is what people in venture capital call "timing", does the unravelling of the existing script line up with the scaling of this idea?

This means that to create, it is crucial to deeply understand what is being destroyed. In a sense, we must _become what we're trying to destroy_.
