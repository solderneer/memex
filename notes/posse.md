This is an interesting community I found called [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) who are focused on online data ownership and personal blogging. The POSSE ideology is that you should first publish your content on your own site, and then cross post it to all the social media platforms.

In doing so you can preserve ownership, better search, reduce third party dependence, own canonical URLs. The syndication usually comes with a permashortlink, to enable discovery of the original content, improve SEO on original posts, and if people copy it, they'll also copy the permashortlinks.

It's probably worth thinking about how some of this best practice changes with technologies like IPFS and content addressing. For example, images using CIDs will be much more resilient to link changes. I really don't trust myself to maintain old links haha.
