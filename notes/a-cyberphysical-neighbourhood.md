This is a thought inspired by books like [The Network State](https://thenetworkstate.com/). As we move towards digital connection, and are able to communicate instantaenously all across the world: the definition of neighbours has shifted.

The unit of social structure has shifted from family to self-defined support networks which are unbounded by physical locality. (eg. A discord server might be one such neighbourhood)

The idea of neighbourhood and community is about who people relate to. **Increasingly, people relate to people they have never met in person.**

Neighbourhoods are not about where you live, but are multi-dimensional constructs of locality. **Located not in physical space, but cyber-physical space: between networks of people.**
