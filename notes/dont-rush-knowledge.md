Every second we spend awake, the brain processes an incredible amount of data from all five senses. Most of that data is discarded, but some of it is retained and integrated into our complex associative memory system. In [How the Mind Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_Mind_Works), Steven Pinker talks about associative memory as a tool to only remember what matters and uncover the bits that hold the greatest meaning.

Highly associated concepts hold the greatest meaning, implies that to understand something truly, requires the process of associating it with other concepts in the mind. To take an abstract idea and weave it into the connective fabric of thought takes time and play: it cannot be rushed.

Consistency beats speed in knowledge accumulation, reading an article slowly and integrating its wisdom into my own is far better than quickly reading through ten.
