**Dearest Reader,**

It's been slightly more than 1 week since I started the [[104-days-of-summer-vacation]] experiment, and it is almost 2 weeks into the start of my summer vacation proper. Tomorrow, I will be flying to India for a week, to spend some time with my grandparents, and so I felt that today would be a good time to do a retrospective.

In [[summer-2023]], I outlined some key objectives for this summer. In general, it's quite clear to me after 2 weeks, that I put down way more goals than what I could reasonably accomplish. But in this letter, I'll just be going over and reviewing each of those objectives.

**Goal 1:** With the [[104-days-of-summer-vacation]] experiment, things are going well and on track although I've missed a couple of days. I think that's okay, I have to approach this with a little bit of forgiveness - that's why this letter is titled `most-days`.

**Goal 2:** I have not started on the long form pieces yet, because I haven't had any experience that has deeply inspired me to write in long-form.

**Goal 3:** The [[90-day-transformation]] challenge is still ongoing, and it is great that I am able to keep my exercise practices alive and well. The India trip will be a downer on this, but I should be able to pick right back up after.

**Goal 4:** The work on developing a website for Happily Ever After is ongoing and I am excited for you to see it soon!

**Goal 5 and 6:** I haven't had time to start on these yet, but I probably will once I'm back from India.

**Goal 7:** I went to [[the-zuzalan-dream-2|a social event]] last week, but haven't managed to go to one this week.

**Goal 8:** I've been trying to tweet more often, but again finding it very hard to remember.

**Goal 9:** I have started to apply for grants and fellowships! But I've yet to hear back, I also managed to curate a list/tracker for these applications on Notion which has been useful.

**Goal 10:** This is coming together nicely, we will be scheduling our first meeting once I'm back from India!

I think broadly speaking, I'm quite happy about progress on Goal 1, 3, 4, 9 and 10! And I am lukewarm on the rest. But it's okay, all in good time.
