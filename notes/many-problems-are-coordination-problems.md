One of the reasons I think web3 and DAOs are a promising line of exploration, is because many problems in the world exist as coordination problems. See: [[malthusian-traps]].

web3 more than a engineering technology, is a social technology that could solve complicated multi-polar problems. And these problems are growing due to a rise in automation (especially artificial intelligence, which removes agency of humans from the output of the optimization process)/

>A basic principle unites all of the multipolar traps above. In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don’t take it die out.

>Turning “satisfying customers” and “satisfying citizens” into the _outputs_ of optimization processes was one of civilization’s greatest advances and the reason why capitalist democracies have so outperformed other systems.
