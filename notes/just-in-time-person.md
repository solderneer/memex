A just-in-time person is what [Venkatesh Rao](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/) refers to a a person _selling a naked call_. In his essay, [The Premium Mediocre Life of Maya Millennial](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/) he talks about people who have no skills yet, but _fake it til they make it_ as a strategy for survival.

By avoiding learning any skill, it is possible to learn skills only after getting the job, a form of reducing the sunken cost of not being hired. In his essay, it is analogous to selling a naked call: selling something you don't even own. I find it more similar to [just-in-time compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) where you learn to do the job on the job.
