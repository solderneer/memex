**Ho Chi Minh is a beautifully chaotic place, with an ambience of ambition and fast-paced culture. The street food is a must-try, with the streetside Banh Mi, Pho and Com tam, being my favourites.**

I went to Ho Chi Minh to explore the startup and crypto scene, given the wide-scale adoption of cryptocurrencies and play-to-earn games. [Happily Ever After](https://hea.care/) is searching for a place where it could provide real, immediate value and HCM is potentially one of those places.

The developing economy supports an incredible people, and if you get to the well-off neighbourhoods, you find great architecture and pretty views. I spent lots of my time exploring various cafes with Nikita Vattas and the speciality coffee scene is definitely popping off.
