When we put these two together, we can see that we need to subvert the status quo and have as much fun as possible along the way!"

The act of joyfully subverting the status quo could be as simple as something one says. For example, I use the pronoun "she" to refer to God just as a way of poking fun at misogyny in conservative religions.
