>The [_Dark Enlightenment_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment) or the _neo-reactionary movement_, sometimes abbreviated NRx, is an anti-democratic, anti-egalitarian, reactionary philosophy founded by Curtis Yarvin, an American software engineer and blogger under the pen name “_Mencius Moldbug_".

I haven't particularly had the opportunity to dive deep into the neo-reactionary literature as of yet. But, my brief knowledge on the matter is

1) They trace back the problems in Western civilisation to enlightenment-era ideas of humanism and democracy
2) They advocate for the replacement of modern nation-states, democracy and government with authoritarian city-states.
