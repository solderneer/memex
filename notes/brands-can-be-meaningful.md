**Brands are currently driven by the consumerist profit-motive. But, they don't have to be and we can look at cults for some inspiration.**

[[brands-form-identities]], but cults show us that identity-forming is about more than consuming content and goods. Cultural participation is about action, and owning products is an insignificant form of participation.

Example: _Buying Nike shoes doesn't mean that you are fit_

What people crave are forms of true cultural membership, meaningful narratives, but DTC brands were never incentivized to meet those needs. Some quotes from [Life After Lifestyle](https://subpixel.space/entries/life-after-lifestyle/):

> The Lifestyle era was not about creating culture; it was about attaching brands onto existing cultural contexts.

>For some organizations, culture has become the product itself, and products have become secondary, auxiliary, to the production of culture.

> Â Their job is not to drive value, but to add another layer of depth to the community, to enshrine the practices.

Some current examples include [SoulCycle](https://www.soul-cycle.com/) ,[The Nearness](https://www.thenearness.coop/) and [CrossFit](https://www.crossfit.com/).

Today, [[culture-is-a-service]]. But it doesn't have to be and it is evolving. 

[[culture-is-a-product]]. 

Just like how in the 2010s, the API-fication of supply chains opened up lifestyle brands, in the 2020s, crypto-currencies _open up the space of incentivized idealogies, networked publics, and co-owned faiths_.
