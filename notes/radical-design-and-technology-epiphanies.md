>Scholars have often neglected some of the most intriguing forms of design, i.e., when design brings a radical perspective, when it contributes to the redeﬁnition of an industry, and the creation of a new paradigm. In this short note I hope to set the stage for this new frontier of research in design management. In particular I propose two ﬁelds of investigation: the role of design to radically innovate the meaning of products and services, and the interaction of radical design with radical technologies, which I call technology epiphanies, i.e., the identiﬁcation of the most powerful meaning enabled by a breakthrough technology.

[This paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5885.2011.00807.x) by Roberto Verganti, illustrates a stark contrast with other startup building methods like LEAN canvas.

>A company looking for radical innovation of meaning does not get too close to users, because the meaning users give to things is bounded by the existing sociocultural regime.

>They have a superior ability to understand, create, and influence new product meanings.
