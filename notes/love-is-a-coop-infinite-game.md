Finite games are games that are played to be won. Infinite games are games that are played to keep playing. Competition is to play against one or many people. Cooperation is playing with other people, either against other people, or the computer.

My personal view on love is that the most successful couples are playing a cooperative, infinite game.**Where it is two people against life, and the goal is to simply keep playing.**
