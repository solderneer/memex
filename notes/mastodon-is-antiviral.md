**Mastodon is a brilliant example of [antiviral design](https://uxdesign.cc/mastodon-is-antiviral-design-42f090ab8d51): it was specifically designed to slow things down a little bit.** After Elon Musk turned Twitter into a blue-tick commodity-driven negative-sum game, I started looking for a new space to bring my social business.

Twitter was designed to concentrate everyone's attention on one twitter/meme/person or thing at this very moment. Virality.

Mastodon has no algorithms, it is just reverse chronological. There is no way to full-text search all posts in the fediverse. And Mastodon users prefer that. They prefer cozy digital environments free of virality and context-collapse ([[dunbar-scale-social-is-cozy]]).
