> A whole new genre of content and creator has moved to the fore: one defined by curating a specific mood or feeling.

[The Vibe Economy](https://thinkforward.wearesocial.com/the-vibe-economy.html) is premised on connecting people through moods and feelings instead of simple interactions. The driving factors of this system are that [[culture-is-a-service]] and people are searching for a sense of community.

Gen Zs and millenials crave belonging, [[brands-form-identities]].

**The Vibe Economy profits not on selling products but on selling a starved version of belonging.** If [[brands-form-identities]] and [[culture-is-a-product]], then brands are not going far enough.
