The Sacred is a feeling of **connectedness, beauty and meaning**, as mentioned by [Ellie Hain](https://twitter.com/ellie__hain) in [Exiting The Void](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqB-1ABZJSM).

The Sacred is personal, it's not religious dogma, in fact it's exactly the opposite. The Sacred can be found in the little things in life.
