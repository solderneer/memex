**tldr; Culture is a service that is sold to brands to help them sell whatever they want to sell.**

In the 2010s, on the heels of the big tech companies like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter emerged a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) movement which revolved around brands like [Supreme](https://www.supremenewyork.com/), [Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com/) and [Daily Harvest](https://www.daily-harvest.com/).

These brands were selling old goods in new ways, leveraging the power of new internet subcultures amplified by social media. The problem for DTC startups is not _"what product to sell"_, but rather _"what subculture of people to target"_. In this sense, [Life After Lifestyle](https://subpixel.space/entries/life-after-lifestyle/) says that **cultural production has become a service industry for the supply chain of generic products**.

Segmenting every available socio-demographic audience into niche brands which piggyback on microinfluencers, gives birth to the **Cultural Production Service Economy (CPSE)**. The ability to classify consumers into these niches is warranted by digital data analytics and marketing tools that are built into our social media applications.

> Class is expressed merely by price points that exist within consumer subcultural categories

And for brands, because [[the-one-man-brand]] everything becomes a distribution problem: purely a matter of target demographic. And [[brands-form-identities]].
