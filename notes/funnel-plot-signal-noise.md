AÂ **funnel plot**Â is a graph designed to check for the existence ofÂ [publication bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias "Publication bias"); funnel plots are commonly used inÂ [systematic reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review "Systematic review")Â andÂ [meta-analyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis "Meta-analysis"). In the absence of publication bias, it assumes that studies with high precision will be plotted near the average, and studies with low precision will be spread evenly on both sides of the average, creating a roughlyÂ [funnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funnel "Funnel")-shaped distribution. Deviation from this shape can indicate publication bias.
