[Beware the man of one study](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/)

Any set of studies will have results distributed on a bell curve. Some of those results will be really good, some of those results could be very bad.

_Without even accounting for statistical malpractice_, it is possible to cherry pick one or many studies that support any viewpoint.

Recommendations for approaching truth:
1. Decrease your confidence about most things if youâ€™re not sure that youâ€™ve investigated every piece of evidence.
2. Do not trust websites which are obviously biased
3. if someone gives you what seems like overwhelming evidence in favor of a certain point of view, donâ€™t trust it until youâ€™ve done a simple Google search to see if the opposite side has equally overwhelming evidence
