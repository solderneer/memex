The idea of [[manufactured-normalcy]] is that most of us live in a present that reuses metaphors that are familiar to us. It reasons that even though we live with technology that vastly outpaces our wildest dreams in the 1900s, everything feel _strangely normal_.

This normalcy is attributed to the fact that, the reality-distortion field that we life in replates new technology into easily understandable metaphors. **We are able to instrumentally use technology through abstractions without comprehending it.**

This is not a question of technology stagnation, but that of user experience stagnation. The behavioural differences between new technologies and existing ones is always minimised. [[good-products-dont-change-the-world]]
