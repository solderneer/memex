**History is written by the winners.** The perspectives we hear about most issues are drastically influenced by the ones who shape the narrative. Digital technologists today spread caution around fake news, but digital history is another medium that is constantly corrupted by the people the control the sites of data storage.

If platforms can control present narratives with such easy, **controlling the past is even easier**. This is why the idea of permenant cryptohistory is so important, the ability to trust that a piece of history is factually unaltered is crucial to establishing globally trusted and shared narratives.

[Brewster Kahle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Kahle) and his work on digital documentation at the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) is pioneering work in the space. Another notable project is [arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) which uses perpetual endowments to cryptographically store and protect media. Arweave founder, Sam Williams, calls the network of content stored on arweave the permaweb, owing to its immutability.
