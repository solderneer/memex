Authenticity as a concept came out of the hipster movement which primarily focuses on a sense of individuality. Of knowing and doing things that no one else is doing. Toby Shurin says in his essay [After Authenticity](https://subpixel.space/entries/after-authenticity/)

>group identifications are resisted because they carry connotations of collective conformity, suggesting a concomitant loss of individuality that renders their members inauthentic

This is in line with a historical need for selfhood, that all came to a head in the social media saturated environment of brand marketing. Our societal script ([[society-is-scripted]]) has always been ridden with ideas of meritocracy, and "you can be whatever you want", and personal uniqueness. **This leads to a deep sense of entitlement to the idea of an authentic self.**

Things do seem to be shifting however. Networked society through the internet is having a collectivist awakening. Social platform blast content and are designed for virality and groupthink ([[mastodon-is-antiviral]]), which makes it hard to have an ethical framework based on scarcity.

In this mix is the idea of [[premium-mediocre]], the usage of brands and aesthetic to contend with economic uncertainty. People are made of brands, identities are co-created with brands just as much as religion, community and other systems of meaning. We are ready to admit that.
