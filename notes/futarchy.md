Futarchy is a decision making framework that I first came across, while reading [a post on the Ethereum Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/21/introduction-futarchy). It is a futuristic form of government proposed by Robin Hanson. Vitalik here outlines the general principle of furatchy: using two prediction markets "for" and "against" a written proposal to make decisions.

> Vote values, bet beliefs

After x amount of time, the markets are closed, and the market with the higher price is implemented (ie if the "for" market has a higher price, the proposal is passed). All trades on the unimplemented market is returned. On maturity, the success metric for the proposal is measured and rewards are allocated.

**Arguments for futarchy:**
1) Fixing voter apathy (through incentives for correct votes)
2) Fixing rational irrationality (focus more on proposals rather than politics/personalities)
3) Market pressure to improve outcomes

**Arguments against futarchy:**
1) Manipulation by rich actors/stakeholders
2) Volatility and self-referential (ponzi) pricing
3) Zero-sum, might lead to low participation
4) Hard to encapsulate human values into success metrics

Scott Alexander wrote [a nice FAQ on prediction markets](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/prediction-market-faq?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MjMyMjMwNywicG9zdF9pZCI6OTE3MTgzMTEsImlhdCI6MTY3MTUxMDQzOSwiZXhwIjoxNjc0MTAyNDM5LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItODkxMjAiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.tz5Ip4DVPvb2ZuW7AjVPwdKTlqfnUArk5d8hpNdSyWw&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) countering some of the arguments against.

Counter-counter (1):
> Is there any amount of money that could successfully manipulate a market? I think the answer is that you need to have more money than the sum total owned by everybody else in the world who wants to make $1 million quick. And at the limit, thereâ€™s always Goldman Sachs - who watch financial markets very closely, definitely want to make $1 million quick, and have aÂ _lot_Â of money.

Counter-counter (3):
>The futures and commodities markets are also zero-sum, but attract billions of dollars by giving companies an opportunity to hedge risk.

>Whatever the theoretical answer to this question, lots of peopleÂ _do_Â invest in prediction markets instead of stocks sometimes; several existing prediction markets have questions with hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading volume.
