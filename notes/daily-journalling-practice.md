I think journalling is important, perhaps one of the most important things for anyone who cares about personal development. So much of achieving personal milestones comes down to maintaining _mind like water_ as mentioned by books like [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/).

Writing things down keeps the mind free to concentrate on the things at hand and in the moment. Journalling is also a form of therapy, and [gratitude journalling especially has been shown to have impacts of mental health and well-being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPPPFqsECz0).

[[systems-not-goals]], I believe in using tools to live better. In designing my daily journalling system, I have a few goals.

1. Should take less than 5 minutes everyday (I'm lazy and busy)
2. Should work with my existing tools (Obsidian, Todoist)
3. Should be meaningful and effective, not just writing down what happened that day

After some research in essential daily prompts for journalling ([here](https://www.mindful.org/how-to-start-a-mindful-journaling-practice/), [here](https://thehumancondition.com/starting-a-journaling-practice-types-prompts/) and [here](https://www.omaritani.com/blog/daily-journal)), I've finalized on something. I do expect this to be an **evolving process**, expect changes as time goes by.

# â˜€ In the morning:

**Intention**: what short and long term goals am I working towards today?
> I am grateful to be working on goals A, B, and C.

**Affirmation**: a statement that defines what I want to me.
>I am successful and I am living in my success every day.

**Top three priorities**: three things which upon completion, I would feel fulfilled for the day
 - [ ] Thing 1
 - [ ] Thing 2
 - [ ] Thing 3

# ðŸŒ™ At night

**Daily Reflection (3-5 sentences)**
1. What were the three awesome things that happened today?
2. What didnâ€™t go so well and how could I have made today better?
3. What am I grateful for?
