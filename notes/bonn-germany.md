I visited [[bonn-germany]] all the way back in 2017, on a school trip at [NUS High School](https://www.nushigh.edu.sg/). Since this note-taking practice was started in 2022, I do not have much recollection of takeways from Bonn, beyond the fact that it was a cool place.

Bonn was the first time I had been outside Asia, coincidentally I also managed to see snow for the first time on this trip. Since we were there during Christmas season, we also explored the many cute Christmas markets that were peppered around the town. Now that I'm writing this in [[london-uk]], I do see that they are all the same ðŸ˜…

My host in Bonn was probably the biggest culture shock for me. Of the 6 subjects he took in school, 3 were English, French and Latin which I had to sit through classes for. This is starkly contrasted to the STEM focused education in Singapore.

The fact that I also like [[vienna-austria]] seems to be a sign telling me learn German. And to visit Berlin at some point.
