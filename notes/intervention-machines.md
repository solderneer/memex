This is a peel-off through from thinking about [[wicked-problems]]. One of the key characteristics of [[wicked-problems]] is that, they are constantly evolving. And they don't really have solutions, they only have "interventions", which are stopgaps that work in a period of time.

That leads that if the standard scientific-engineering approach doesn't work because of the lack of an optimal solution, then what you really need is a meta system. Instead of generating a solution, you need a solution to generate solutions, that work given the current situation. This is kind of like [[public-policy-networks]], it's also interesting interplay with an imagination of DAOs -> [[daos-are-digital-organisms]].

In fact, life is kinda of interesting in its solutions to wicked, complex problems. And the solution comes from being generative. Or using autopoieses to dynamically respond to challenges.
