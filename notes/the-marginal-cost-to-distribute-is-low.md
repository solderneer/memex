**It costs nothing to retweet a tweet, to share a blog post, or mention somone's idea in a post.** The advent of the internet means that the "publishing" bottlenecks that existed in the pre-web world, no longer exist.

In the web, everyone is a publisher and its as easy as setting up a tumblr account. This is because web2 was build for self-expression ([[web2-is-for-self-expression-not-thought]]) which lowers the barriers of entry for anyone to talk about their own ideas.
