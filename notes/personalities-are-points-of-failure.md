The centralization of a project's brand around one or a group of people can form points of failure for the organization. To derive a purely decentralized organization, would mean to diminish the responsibilities and roles of individual founders: [[subtraction-is-a-virtue]].

An example here is [Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.ca) whose statements is able to single-handedly alter the pricer of Ether. In contrast, [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) is fully decentralized as the psuedonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, is nowhere to be found.
