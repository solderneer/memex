Welcome weary internet traveller, you might know me as Shan / **solderneer** / or if you know me really well _Sudharshan Sundaramahlingam._

Read about my [evolutionary purpose](https://solderneer.me/letters/answer-the-call/)!

_Chronological is tired. Categorical is wired._ I tend to hop around industries and themes, chasing what interdisciplinary problems that span multiple types of work. So, what follows is my life, decomposed into defined and legible categories.

## _Projects & Products_

<Callout emoji="üíú" color="bg-violet-50">Things I‚Äôve contributed to that provide any kind of utility or service.</Callout>

**Health:** I'm working on a community health monitoring framework at [Happily Ever After](https://hea.care). Previously, I worked on a sleep intervention application in collaboration researchers from the [NUS Sleep and Cognition Lab](https://sleepcognition-lab.org/).

**Space:** designed and built a [STM32 based cube satellite](https://github.com/solderneer/ARMsat), for the EG1310 module at the National University of Singapore in 2017. I also gave [a short talk](https://engineers.sg/video/tm32-based-nanosatellite-project-hackware-v3-14159--1773) about it, at Hackware v3.14.

**Robotics:** with my friend, [Isaac Tay](https://github.com/IsaacTay), I worked on a swarm robotics platform called [Sentibots](https://github.com/solderneer/Sentibots). The project was was a finalist in the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair 2016, and was formally published at the IRC-SET 2016 conference.

**Embedded Systems:** made a [custom 16-bit microprocessor](https://github.com/solderneer/artemis) on a Xilinx FPGA, complete with its own instruction set architecture. And, as always, talked about this at Hackware. I also worked on automated embedded system verification and testing pipelines for warehouse robots at [Hope Technik](https://www.hopetechnik.com/).

**Security:** contributed to a embedded-friendly certificate management system at [MicroSec](https://www.usec.io/) and worked on client side interface design and development for their Intrusion Detection System.

**Full-stack Software:**

- Built [sellingx.io](http://sellingx.io) to facilitate peer-to-peer resale of student clubbing tickets alongside Daniel. In 5 days, we had **600 daily active users** and moved about 300 pounds of money‚Ä¶. then Stripe deplatformed us for violating their Terms of Service.
- During National Service, I developed military software infrastructure including internal booking/tracking systems and a custom educational platform. **Some** of [the work](https://github.com/digital-okra) is ‚ú®¬†open source ‚ú®.

**Tech for good:** worked on a sonar powered wearable that uses haptic feedback to help to the visually impaired, during a local hackathon (Hack n Roll).

**Random websites:**
- [colorga.me](https://colorga.me/) - a fun game to do with colors
- [Color Me](https://colorme.solderneer.me/) - a personality test, you guessed it, also based on colors

**Misc. projects for fun:**

- [An FPGA audio synthesiser](https://github.com/solderneer/Synthesia)
- [Real time visualization tool for neural network training](https://github.com/makerforceio/nviz)
- [_Kerbal Space Program_ hardware gaming console](https://makerforce.io/the-ksp-command-station-2/)

## _Startup Organizations_

<Callout emoji="üöÄ" color="bg-violet-50">Projects that grew too big, that I now consider separate organizational entities.</Callout>

**Happily Ever After:** researching healthcare systems, and the complex adaptive nature of individual well-being. I haven't quite formulated how to explain [Happily Ever After](https://hea.care/) to people, but the _latest attempt_ is that we are building socio-technology for a network that delivers preventive healthcare.

**Beep:** a [voice-first chat application](https://beepvoice.app/) that used AI transcription and voice generation to provide two-way interoperability between audio and text communication. Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt manage to get it to scale, but the real alpha was the experience we gained, and the friendships I forged.

## _Research & Writing_

<Callout emoji="üß†" color="bg-violet-50">Deep thinking, wicked problems, protocol fictions, essays and creativity.</Callout>

**Health & Human Flourishing:** interweaving technological, social, cultural, economical, philosophical and spiritual dimensions of delivering holistic healthcare. Unravelling the threads that underpin healthcare coordination failure, and advocating for human-centered sociotechnologies to power the future of human flourishing. I write about this actively on [The Pink Zone](https://heacare.substack.com).

**Biotechnology:** still fascinated by the civilisational unlock of brain-computer interface tech. Gave a [couple of](https://engineers.sg/video/openbci-an-introduction-to-brain-computer-interfaces-hackware-v5-5-x-stackx--3629) [talks](https://engineers.sg/video/love-at-first-byte-a-romantic-journey-into-the-future-of-us-geekcampsg-2019--3718) on their importance, the OpenBCI platform and its limitations.

**Education:** spent 6 months deeply exploring alternate realities around preserving meaning in educational systems, a preference for academies over universities and protocols to encourage life-long learning. During this time, I [built knowledge graphs](https://github.com/axiomacademy/content-loader), a [digital microuniversity](https://github.com/axiomacademy/solo), and a [thought-apprentice matching system](https://github.com/axiomacademy/v0.1-student-app). Wrote about some of the ideas [here](https://makerforce.io/learning-used-to-be-fun/), [here](https://makerforce.io/institutionalised-learning/) and [here](https://makerforce.io/do-you-need-to-be-taught-to-teach/). _Done in collaboration and with support from [Audacity](https://audacity.world), a Singapore based impact collective._

**Some of my hits that I‚Äôm especially proud of:**

- [Technology‚Äôs ultimate purpose is vitality](https://heacare.substack.com/p/technologys-ultimate-purpose-is-vitality)
- [Insurance shouldn‚Äôt wash cars](https://heacare.substack.com/p/insurance-shouldnt-wash-cars)
- [Institutionalized Learning](https://makerforce.io/institutionalised-learning/)

## _Personal Culture_

**Words:** I read like _literally everything_. Favourite blogs include [Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/), [Not Boring](https://www.notboring.co/), [Ex Urbe](https://www.exurbe.com/about/), [Ribbonfarm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/), [Subpixel Space](https://subpixel.space/). Favourite books include [‚ÄúGodel, Escher, Bach‚Äù](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Godel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567), [Braiding Sweetgrass](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17465709-braiding-sweetgrass), [Reinventing Organizations](https://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/en/), and [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0141033576). Meander through what I've read, in my [üìö Library](https://solderneer.notion.site/7f580c6801a1407a849d2dd01752c815?v=fb709826213142b7b9bd8f2e7d91b02c).

**Coffee:** Training to be an amateur barista, one pour at a time. I‚Äôm not going anywhere without my Baratza Encore, Aeropress and a bag of [kiss the hippo‚Äôs _George Street Blend_](https://kissthehippo.com/collections/coffee).

**Fitness and Longevity:** I dealt with an eating disorder as a teenager, and so I care very deeply about the well-being of my mind, body and soul. I do regular calisthenics, stick to a 16-8 intermittent fast and try my best to eat foods that are full of life _(a hard ask for a student)._

_and just to top it off, I also play chess badly, watch lots of trashy romantic comedies, and occasionally write poetry._
