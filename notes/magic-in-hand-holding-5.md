**Dearest Reader,**

Life's not all about work, there are more dimensions to each of us than what we decidedly show others online. Especially in semi-professional spaces like blogs and twitter.

Today, my letter is not of words. Instead, I'd like to share some pictures that we drew, and say that some days there's a simple magic in hand-holding. Where mere presence is a gift. In those days, it's nice to appreciate the people who ground us. I hope you might do so too.
