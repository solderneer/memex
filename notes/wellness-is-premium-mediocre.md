* In the same way that premium mediocrity describes our society as in a transition phase between industrialist modernity and digital post-scarcity, the wellness industry is a transition phase between institutional reactive modern healthcare and holistic post-modern preventive care.
* The wellness industry even makes sugar water vaguely aspirational -> [[culture-is-a-service]] and productizes wellness to increase consumerism
* A different approach is to instead push people to be self-sufficient, quickly making itself irrelevant
	* Rhetoric like you **have** to do yoga to be healthy, and you **have** to buy expensive organic foods to be healthy, are actively harmful, especially to those who can't afford it.
* The unaffordability of healthcare (especially in the US) is another sign that this is a transition state to a better health ecosystem.
* `#livingwell` is more of a self-branding exercise than an actual desire to live well -> ergo going to the gym to take instagram selfies
