[Microsolidarity](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/) is a network working on building practices for community-building, especially in small groups.

It's built on foundational theories like [[internal-family-systems]] and [[full-circle-leadership]].

The [practices](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/practices/crewing) in microsolidarity are super meaningful for both [[happily-ever-after]] and the Poiesis network project. I'm especially interested in the [Care Pods](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IUXBpZJas2MRNlrKDu4KBivZjBw67RQ9o7accovv4fU/edit#heading=h.bcg99cglo63l) (ICT sequence ) as a supplementary process for Ritual.
