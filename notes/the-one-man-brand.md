The proliferation of APIs and tooling for the supply chain like [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) and [CA.LA](https://ca.la/) allows people to spin up fashion brands like a Digitalocean Droplet. This massively reduces the barrier to entry to starting a brand: micropreneurs can active their twitter audiences through selling t-shirts in a single day.

This proves to be a democratizing force and an entry point for many new entrepreneurs, enabling all sorts of subcultural plays. The influencer economy acts as the last-mile delivery system for this pattern as [[culture-is-a-service]].
